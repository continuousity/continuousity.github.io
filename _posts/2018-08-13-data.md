## Henrick's Hawaiian metabarcoding

- data summary
    - raw amplicon data
    - rarified otu and haplotype tables
    - three main products:
        - across chronosequence
        - across elevation (temp and precip gradient)
        - collembola invasion
    - reference collection forthcoming
- motivation
    - Dimensions project sampling across the Hawaiian chronosequence and stratified across the forest profile (from floor to canopy) yielded $> 10^6$ specimens.
    - How to deal with this massive amount of material?  Too expensive for keyout each specimen.  This leads to metabarcoding
- metabarcoding
    - issue: body size and DNA content: DNA content is super linear with body length
    - solution: for Hawaii arthropods have a limited size range, so we can sort into a few size categories to mostly control for DNA content
    - issue: exponential PCR amplification based on primer mismatch 
    - solutions:
        - some patterns are interesting within close relatives where this bias does not matter, e.g. within lineage response to climate/elevation
        - taking average of multiple markers averages out the bias of each
        - statistical approaches for correcting for bias
    - we have a high throughput pipeline fro taking sorted specimens to sequencing to analysis
    - issue: sorting is slow
- for Hawaii beating samples
    - barcode by size by site by plant separately
    - cluster OTUs
    - make an OTU table by rarifying each pooled sequencing run to standard number of sequences
    - also make a haplotype table by clustering "OTUs" with 0 divergence
- similar data also exist for Hawaii environmental gradients
- Collembola invasion
    - 44% of abundance of arthropods on Big Island
    - could be predator release: based on gut content no spiders eat them, but we haven't looked at carabids yet
    - abundance of collembola relates with age: most abundance of collembola are on young and old substrates
- Something to look at: does copy number vary with genetic diversity? We might expect that more copy number allows for more diversity
