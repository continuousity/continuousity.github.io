## Paper ideas reporting back

### Framework - Macroecology + Macroevolution
* Lead - Brian McGill
* Idea for a quick and dirty paper
* Call for macroecologists and macroevolutionary biologists to work more closely together even though there has been some progress lately with the eco-evo modelling stuff that's been happening lately.
    * We've seen lots of work on the micro-micro world, but we want to put together the macro-macro world.
* Two figures that are already pretty well defined.
* A couple figures with ecologcial and evolutionary variables coming together as a means for generating hypotheses.
* Maybe aim for GEB

**A lot of these Framework papers are quite lame.**

### Invasiveness - Nativeness + Invasiveness
* Lead - Jairo Patino
* Compare across different archipelagos the level of species richeness components (native, endemic, exotic) to see how SAR varies.
    * Compare across taxonomic groups: Plants, lizards, birds, arthropods
* Richness compared to total area of the island, but also with respect to area of habitat type for different taxonomic groups.
* Got ideas for HI, Canaris, Azores, Galapagos, and whatever else they get hands on.
    * Use checklists, but also supplementing as much as possible.
* What kinds of data:
    * Species richness per island for different groups
    * Vegetation types
    * (Holger Kreft & Global vegetational network have a butt-load of island plant native/invasive data).

**I have a cholroplast bias.**

### Alpha/Beta - The role of diversification in shaping local community structure on islands.
* Lead - Luke Mahler
* Kinds of data:
    * Whether an island has in situ speciation or not w/in an island
    * Island characteristics (age/area)
    * Island richness
    * Plot level presence/absence (Alpha diversity)
    * Also would be neat to know whether species are native or introduced
    * Things that would be nice to have
        * Would be nice to have Abundance w/in plots
        * Also climate, elevation, vegetation
        * Also genetic data (Fst)

### Alpha/Beta - Alpha/beta area curves under a neutral island model.
* Lead - Ben Peter
* Community structure from a neutral perspective
* How alpha/beta diversity would change as area increases?
* Discussed coalescence models
* Perhaps doing a spatially explicit model would be better
* Force immigration from the mainland
* You can trick a spatially explicit model by making patches localities and implementing a strange dispersal kernel.

**As long as its neutral its possible.** - J. Rosindell's new catch phrase.
**And would you want data?...** ... **No.**

### Island Ontogeny - Effect of island ontogeny/habitat dynamics on diversity patterns
* Lead - Rampal Etienne
* Not so much modelling, but really can we detect that from data!
* Is there an effect of island ontogeny on island diversity patterns?
* Start with ontogeny but maybe expand to any kind of habitat dynamics.
* Can you get a better fit to a model that incorporates ontogeny than a model that doesn't.
    * DAISIE assumes the island is there and there's a constant effect on the rates.
* Perhaps there are more species than you should have because of an extinction debt for some reason.
* Comparing across taxonomic groups and across archipelagos.
* Kinds of data:
    * Island ontogeny data (really good data on how area changed)
        * Island age or substrate age?
        * Desirable: an area/time relationship.
    * All the other data (phylogenies, etc, etc)
    * Jairo/Rosie have lots of data that would be appropriate for this.

### Radiation - Why radiate?
* Lead - ? et al (but see James Rosindell)
* Whether certain taxa are special, what causes them to radiate, whether something causes them to radiate in islands.
* Kinds of data:
    * Phylogenies big enough at the species level to contain lots of stuff from the mainland
    * Slice the phylogenies up into clades of equal age and compare island clades to mainland clades to see if there's anything special about them that caused them to radiate.
    * Other nice things: Abundances and Fst (in the spirit of the workshop)
* Could you use Fst to differentiate or identify taxonomic bias (radiation by oversplitting).
    * "Speciation-by-taxonomist"

**'Just why radiate' is enough**

### Radiations - Mechanistic model of radiations
* Lead - ? et al
* Uber-MESS model (Look at all the things the mess model can doe).
* Kinds of data:
    * Loads of data
