Pedro updates DAISEY model to include area as a driver of rates of extinction, cladogenesis, immigration.  Like DAISEY model we consider the ontogeny of one island or island complex through time.  So far only area-dependent *extinction* implemented.

When considering data simulated with ontonogenic change in extinction, estimates from models that ignore otogeny are largely similar to a model with ontogeny, except for immigration, which is underestimated in the model without ontogeny.
