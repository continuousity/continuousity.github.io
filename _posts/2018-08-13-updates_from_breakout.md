## macroeco hearts macroevo

Brian would like folks to write 6 case studies

## alpha/beta

Outline of paper:
- Intro
- Theory box to motivate hypotheses
- Case studies
    - Hawaii trees
    - Azores arthropds
    - Galapagos snails
    - Maybe Rosie's spiders

In the larger group discussion we talked about controlling for spatial and environmental "volume" when calculating gamma

## genomics of early speciation

- Importance of admixture versus standing genetic diversity to produce adaptive radiations
- Could use Angela's nematode, excitingly those data include traits like pH tollerance
- Soliciting further datasets
- Could these emperical insights help ground the MESS model?

## island vs. mainland 

The group likes the idea of applying a BiSSE-like model being developed in Rampal's lab.  This model would consider how the states of being an island endemic, mainland endemic, or cosmopolitan influences speciation rate in a full likelihood approach.

Some comments came up:
- What about area effects---islands are small and that's why their radiations are thought to be interesting
- Latitude also matters for diversification so should be included

There were two proposed solutions:
- One is to include these as additional covariates in the BiSSE-like model (e.g. speciatoin is dependent not only on island versus mainland, but also the area covered by the lineage and its mean latitude)
- The other idea is a more data-driven approach: take random spatially-explicit samples that control for area and latitude (island "coockie cutters") and compare clade richness and age of the true islands to island coockie cutter samples from mainlands
